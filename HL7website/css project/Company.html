                        <h3>What is HL7?</h3>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Health Level Seven (HL7) is a set of standards that incorporate file-based transactions and
                            the newer XML-based Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) protocols to establish
                            methods to exchange electronic health information. These standards create rules for how to
                            structure data and allow for a seamless flow of information between systems. Healthcare
                            organizations who openly adopt standards like HL7 have the tools required to make important
                            operational content like patient data and staff scheduling content available to one another
                            to enable automation and more efficient workflows in multi-application environments. HL7
                            standards don"’"t regulate how to build healthcare systems or applications, but provide a
                            guide for how clinical information should be compiled. According to HL7 international, the
                            standards are recognized as the most commonly used in the world.
                            The HL7 standards in healthcare have similarities to the Dewey Decimal system in libraries.
                            Librarians follow rules for how each nonfiction title should be described and categorized in
                            a consistent structure following accepted rules. Readers who want to find a specific title
                            can learn how to retrieve the title, regardless of which library they are in. Many other
                            industries have similar standards, often accredited by the American National Standards
                            Institute (ANSI).

                                <br />
                                <p>
                                    The HL7 V2 standard was created mostly by clinical interface specialists and was
                                    designed to provide a framework in which data could be exchanged between disparate
                                    clinical systems.

                                    The V2 standard provides 80 percent of the interface framework, plus the ability to
                                    negotiate the remaining 20 percent of needs on an interface-by-interface basis. The
                                    standard achieves this goal by:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Defining HL7 encoding rules, groupings, cardinality, and the default character
                                        set (i.e. ASCII).</li>
                                    <li>Providing support for local variations in data interchanges by allowing optional
                                        fields, additional messages, or additional portions of messages.</li>
                                    <li>Evolving and adapting to changes required in local implementations, or to issues
                                        discovered via real-world usage of the standard.</li>
                                    <li>Supporting batch processing of message file transfers.</li>
                                    <li>Considering the relationship between the HL7 standard protocol with other
                                        protocols, such as lower layer protocols (i.e. avoiding replication of
                                        features), applications protocols (notably DICOM and X12, and protocols
                                        published by ASTM and IEEE), and other proprietary healthcare protocols.</li>

                                </ul>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Generally, all 2.X versions are backward-compatible with earlier versions because
                                    the V2 standard allows applications to ignore message elements they do not expect.
                                    This means that an older application can receive and process messages from newer
                                    applications using newer HL7 versions "-" i.e., messages containing more segments
                                    and/or fields "-" without producing an error.

                                <h4>HL7 V3</h4>
                                <br />
                                <p>
                                    The HL7 V3 standard was first released in late 2005, and was strongly influenced by
                                    the government and medical information users rather than clinical interface
                                    specialists. The V3 version is not backwards compatible with V2 versions of the
                                    standard, so existing V2 interfaces will not (without considerable modification) be
                                    able to communicate with interfaces using V3.

                                    HL7 V3 was created to address some specific challenges identified in the HL7 V2
                                    standard, including:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>An implied, rather than consistent, data model.</li>
                                    <li>An absence of formal methodologies with data modeling, creating inconsistencies
                                        and difficulties in understanding.</li>
                                    <li>A lack of well-defined roles for applications and messages used in different
                                        clinical functions.</li>
                                    <li>Too much flexibility and not enough of a full solution.</li>
                                </ul>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The goals of HL7 V3 were to increase worldwide adoption of the standard, define a
                                    consistent data model, create a more precise and less vague standard, and create an
                                    entirely new standard that would not be hindered by legacy issues. The decision to
                                    make HL7 V3 a new standard (and incompatible with older and more widely implemented
                                    V2 versions) means that it is has not been widely adopted thus far.

                                    To adopt HL7 V3, users would need to create and maintain HL7 V2-based interfaces
                                    with HL7 V2-based applications, while deploying new V3-based applications and
                                    implementing interfaces between them. For this reason, HL7 V3 has been adopted
                                    primarily for use in applications without legacy communication requirements, without
                                    historical use of HL7 V2 in communications, or in regions/locations that have high
                                    government enforcement of HL7 V3 usage.

                                <h4>FHIR</h4>
                                <br />

                                <p>
                                    In 2014, HL7 introduced an important alternative to HL7 V2 and V3 standards: the
                                    Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard. FHIR, which was first
                                    drafted in 2011, is an open standard that enables new apps and legacy systems to
                                    more easily exchange data than in the past. FHIR was developed to not only improve
                                    interoperability and enhance efficiency of communication but also streamline
                                    implementation compared with previous standards, providing easily understood
                                    specifications and enabling developers to capitalize on common Web technologies.

                                    FHIR builds on previous standards, including HL7 V2, HL7 V3, and CDA (Clinical
                                    Document Architecture—part of HL7 V3). But unlike those other standards, FHIR
                                    employs RESTful web services and open web technologies, including not only XML (used
                                    by previous standards) but also JSON and RDF data formats. These technologies should
                                    be familiar to most developers, reducing the learning curve compared with other
                                    standard.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    FHIR also offers multiple options for exchanging data among systems. For example, it
                                    supports messaging (similar to HL7 V2), documents (like CDA), as well as a RESTful
                                    API approach. The RESTful API approach can simplify data sharing and reduce the time
                                    to onboard new data exchange partners by replacing point-to-point interfaces with
                                    one-to-many interfaces. This approach offers the potential for greater
                                    interoperability among a wide array of systems and devices—including not only
                                    electronic health record (EHR) systems but also mobile apps, mobile devices, medical
                                    devices, and wearables.

                                    FHIR defines the meaningful pieces of data that are stored or exchanged as
                                    “resources” (which are somewhat similar to “segments” within HL7 V2 messages). A
                                    resource can include metadata, text, or bundled collections of information that form
                                    clinical documents. Each resource has a unique identifying tag, just like a web page
                                    URL. That tag makes it easy for devices and applications to access required data
                                    without complicated data exchange processes. The RESTful API approach also enables
                                    resources to be updated and delete.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    FHIR is inherently suited for mobile apps. With FHIR, APIs can access required data
                                    from multiple systems and provide that data in formats that developers can easily
                                    integrate into their mobile apps. And with FHIR, that data can be shared rapidly
                                    (which is critical for mobile apps) since only the requested data is transmitted.

                                    There has been clear momentum for using FHIR for mobile healthcare apps. In 2014,
                                    the SMART (Substitutable Medical Apps, Reusable Technologies) Health IT project
                                    created the SMART on FHIR API to enable developers to write an app once and run it
                                    anywhere in the healthcare system. And in 2018, Apple created a FHIR-based health
                                    records feature for its iOS operating system, giving users simple access to a range
                                    of healthcare information from hundreds of participating providers.

                                <br />
                                <p>
                                    HL7 v2.x messages use a non-XML encoding syntax based on segments (lines) and
                                    one-character delimiters.[5] Segments have composites (fields) separated by the
                                    composite delimiter. A composite can have sub-composites (components) separated by
                                    the sub-composite delimiter, and sub-composites can have sub-sub-composites
                                    (subcomponents) separated by the sub-sub-composite delimiter. The default delimiters
                                    are carriage return for the segment separator, vertical bar or pipe (|) for the
                                    field separator, caret (^) for the component separator, ampersand (&) for the
                                    subcomponent separator, and number sign (#) for the default truncation separator.
                                    The tilde (~) is the default repetition separator. Each segment starts with a
                                    3-character string that identifies the segment type. Each segment of the message
                                    contains one specific category of information. Every message has MSH as its first
                                    segment, which includes a field that identifies the message type. The message type
                                    determines the expected segment types in the message.[6] The segment types used in a
                                    particular message type are specified by the segment grammar notation used in the
                                    HL7 standards.

                                    The following is an example of an admission message. MSH is the header segment, PID
                                    the Patient Identity, PV1 is the Patient Visit information, etc. The 5th field in
                                    the PID segment is the patient's name, in the order, family name, given name, second
                                    name (or their initials), suffix, etc. Depending on the HL7 V2.x standard version,
                                    more fields are available in the segment for additional patient information.

                                    HL7 v2.x has allowed for the interoperability between electronic Patient
                                    Administration Systems (PAS), Electronic Practice Management (EPM) systems,
                                    Laboratory Information Systems (LIS), Dietary, Pharmacy and Billing systems as well
                                    as Electronic Medical Record (EMR) or Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems.
                                    Currently, the HL7 v2.x messaging standard is supported by every major medical
                                    information systems vendor in the United States.

                                    The HL7 version 3 messaging standard defines a series of Secure Text messages
                                    (called interactions) to support all healthcare workflows.

                                    HL7 v3 messages are based on an XML encoding syntax, as shown in this example:
